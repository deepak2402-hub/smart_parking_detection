# Car Park Space Detection

This project uses OpenCV and computer vision techniques to detect free and occupied parking spaces in a parking lot video feed.

## Features

- Detects available and occupied parking spaces from a video.
- Visualizes the count of available spaces in real-time.
- Uses a pre-defined list of parking space positions (`CarParkPos.pkl`).
- Draws rectangles and overlays text on the video to indicate parking status.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- cvzone
- numpy
- pickle

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy
```

## Files

- `carPark.mp4` — Sample parking lot video.
- `CarParkPos.pkl` — Pickle file storing parking position coordinates.
- `car_park_detection.py` — Main script for parking space detection.

## Usage

1. Ensure `carPark.mp4` and `CarParkPos.pkl` are in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python car_park_detection.py
    ```
3. The video will display with boxes around each parking space. The number of free spaces will be shown at the top.

## Customization

- To use your own parking lot video, replace `carPark.mp4` with your video file.
- To change parking space positions, edit or generate a new `CarParkPos.pkl` file.
